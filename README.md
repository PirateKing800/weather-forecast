## Round 2 Update

Upgrade the dashboard: add filtering by status (#status-filter) and search by title (#search-box), interactive checkboxes to mark tasks complete (#task-list input[type=checkbox]), summary counters (#total-tasks, #completed-tasks, #pending-tasks), and persist task status in localStorage.

This round adds all new features, design tweaks, and logic changes described in the brief.
